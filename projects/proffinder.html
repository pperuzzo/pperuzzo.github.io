                sooner of later, every college students is faced with the important decision of choosing the right
                professor for their classes<br>
                the options are either to used baiased sources (such as ratemyprofessor), or relay on word of mouth.<br>
                proffinder provides different approach to finding professors: making data-driven decision.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                i started by writing a python program to scrape grade distribution data from online available pdfs.<br>
                this allowed me to effectively extract the necessary information to be used for further analysis. the
                scraping system allowed
                for a streamlined data gathering process.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                next, i designed and developed a fully responsive website frontend and backend from scratch.<br>
                i used php laravel for the backend, vue.js and tailwind for the frontend. using my skills in web
                development
                i was able to create an attractive and user-friendly platform to replace having to deal with raw
                disorganized pdf data.<br>
                i built the website with a specific target audience in mind, ensuring that it provided a seamless and
                enjoyable
                experience for students.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                once completed, i deployed the website to aws using elastic beanstalk (ec2, s3, rds).<br>
                using ssh, i logged into the linux machine and configured all the necessary components to allow
                my laravel application to function properly.<br>
                this allowed the website to perform optimally, providing users with quick access to valuable historical
                data for each professor/class.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                the website quickly gained popularity among santa monica college students, reaching more than 20k
                visits.<br>
                this significant user base demonstrated the project's success in addressing the needs of students and
                providing them with essential information to
                enhance their academic experiences.
