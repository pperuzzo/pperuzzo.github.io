        <h2 class="text-md font-bold pt-3">overview</h2>
        <div class="max-w-full md:max-w-xl">
            <p class="pb-2">
                one of the main problem that every developer working on a big project faces is the struggle of
                managing work across different programs.<br>
                daily tasks are usually stored in a project management software, which is not connected to the code
                base.<br>
                reflow aims to solve exaclty this problem.<br>
                by brining a lightweight collaborative kanban-style project management software inside vscode.<br>
                this allows developers to never leave their code editor, and to reference code in their tasks.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                i developed both the frontend and backend of the extension using javascript (vue.js) and typescript,
                creating a
                robust and efficient solution. <br>
                by working with the vscode api, i was able to seamlessly integrate reflow with the code editor.<br>
                i also achieve the sense of integration by using the user's theme colors in the ui, and by recreating
                ui components similar to the ones in vscode.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                to enhance the user experience, i implemented a networking system that allows for real-time
                collaboration.<br>
                this enables users to work together on their projects with ease.<br>
                in addition, i worked on the authentication system using jwt auth. to improve the user experience,
                i also integrated the auth system with third party providers such as github and google, ensuring a
                secure and convenient sign-up
                process.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                to facilitate the management of the extension's users, i also developed a simple admin dashboard using
                php laravel, vue.js and
                tailwind css.<br>
                this tool allowed my teammates and i for easy oversight and administration of the user base, ensuring a
                smooth user experience for
                all.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                the extension quickly gained traction on the vscode marketplace with 0 marketing dollars.<br>
                reflow generated approximately 400 downloads and 100 active users.<br>
                the success of feflow demonstrates its value in providing an efficient and
                collaborative solution for developers, streamlining their workflow and enhancing productivity.
