            <p class="pb-2">
                when scientists have to analyze vast number of protein-protein interactions, it can be useful to
                visualize
                the problem and a graph. related protein connections can be found by analyzing different paths that
                connect them.<br>
                by leveraging vr, i created a way for scientists to analyze how protein interact with each others.<br>
                users can visualize protein interactions as a network with vertices representing the proteins, and edges
                representing the connection.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                users can easily edit and customize the network using simple and intuitive interaction, visualizing the
                relationships between proteins and finding paths between them.
            </p>

            <p class="pb-2">
                i fully developed the software from scratch using unity and c#, and created the 3d graphic side of the
                software, using blender3d. this allowed me to design a useful and visually appealing virtual experiment.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                i started by using available open-source protein-protein interactions databases<br>
                then to store and manage the vast amount of protein data, i created a sqlite database containing more
                than 20
                million protein records. <br>
                this allowed for efficient querying and manipulation directly from the unity software, which was crucial
                part for the software's functionality and performance.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                using graph theory principles i dynamically applied to different networks (graphs) different
                path-finding algorithms to the
                networks, such as the shortest path and breadth-first search algorithm (bfs). <br>
                this approach allowed for a simple and efficient analysis and visualization of protein interactions.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                i also implemented the Fruchterman and Reingold force-directed drawing algorithm for each graph.<br>
                this allowed for all the proteins in the graph to assume a position in relation to how much they depend on each other.
                this gives scientists better insight on the relationships between proteins.
