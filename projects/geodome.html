        <h2 class="text-md font-bold pt-3">overview</h2>
        <div class="max-w-full md:max-w-2xl">
            <p class="pb-2">
                geodome allows fashion brands to gain exposure in high traffic areas at a fraction of the cost.<br>
                by placing vr headsets in strategically located kiosks, shoppers can explore brands' virtual stores by
                wearing a vr headset in the kiosk.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                i wrote the code for the vr software from scratch using unity and c#.<br>
                this included writing all the logic for the virtual shops, importing brand catalogs, and exploring
                cloth simulation solutions.<br>
                i integrated all interactions using the oculus sdk, adding custom logic to a few key interaction
                components.<br>
                my expertise in unity and c# allowed me to build a well-structured and high-performing application that
                met all the requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                implementing a performant cloth simulation solution for vr was a challenging task.<br>
                by focusing on a tradeoff solution, i created a realistic experience while meeting performance
                requirements. this feature enhanced the overall immersion of the software for the end user.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                to provide a more interactive and helpful user experience, i implemented an ai assistant with speech to
                text functionality using ibm watson.<br>
                i designed this ai assistant starting from the ibm dashboard's logical implementation, and then wired
                the
                system to the in-game ui. the ai assistant helped guide users through the virtual stores, answering
                questions,
                and providing customized filters.<br>
                this led to a more seamless vr user experience while navigating the virtual stores.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                i also ensured that the software was optimized for pcvr.<br>
                i debugged the software using unity's profiler, and oculus's ovrmetrics. the software optimization
                ensured that geodome ran smoothly and efficiently on a variety of pcvr hardware configurations.<br>
                this allowed for a consistent and enjoyable experience for all users.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                throughout the project, i managed and worked closely with a team of 3d artists.<br>
                by providing strict modeling and texturing requirements, i was able to achieve the performance
                targets.<br>
                closely managing 3d artists allowed me to create visually pleasing and performant virtual stores for
                brands.
            </p>
            <p>
                lastly, i worked with a 3d scanner to scan and reproduce realistic clothing for the virtual stores.<br>
                by using this technology, i was able to create highly accurate and detailed clothing models, further
                enhancing the realism and immersion of the software.
